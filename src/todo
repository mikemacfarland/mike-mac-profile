Comments: 
    ✔ 1. Add favicon to the site @done(23-01-25 15:15)
    ✔ 2.  "Contact Me" button doesn't do anything @done(23-01-25 23:01)
    ✔ 4. I think the Contact button should highlight a different color - too matchy with the headline @done(23-01-25 18:40)
    ✔ 5. Rotating banner - I think it could be slowed down a bit .. but optional. I also think it should flow left to right, instead of current right to left, but optional. @done(23-01-25 15:35)
    ✔ 6. On mobile, the scrolling has choppy edges, which may or may not be intentional. add box shadow @done(23-01-25 15:33)
    ✔ 7. On desktop, add more padding between the scroll bar and "About" H1 @done(23-01-25 15:29)
    ✔ 8. In about section, lowercase the "T" in the middle. Also capitalize the "I" in "here are a few technologies I enjoy working with" @done(23-01-25 14:00)
    ✔ 9. Put more padding between the main "about" paragraph and the "Here" and bullets section ... just to create some space and hierarchy. @done(23-01-25 15:23)
    ✔ 10. The image beside "About" is too small. (even on mobile it can be a bit larger) @done(23-01-25 15:24)
    ✔ 11. The Professional Experience section feels too crowded. Here's a couple ideas to help: @done(23-01-25 18:55)
        ✔ Put the title first (rather than the location/company) @done(23-01-25 18:41)
        ✔ Consider removing location? It's kind of irrelevant to this case and would save space @done(23-01-25 18:42)
        ✔ Add more padding between subhead (current pink text) & bullets , between each bullet, and between the two jobs. @done(23-01-25 19:01)
        ✔ The ATS section bullets go under the dates on desktop, cut off that border sooner so the dates feel like their own column without other text. @done(23-01-25 19:02)
        ✘ Consider lazy loading these sections as you scroll. would make it feel less heavy. @cancelled(23-01-25 19:03)
        ✔ In experience section, either have every bullet end with a . or none of them. Currently there's a mix. @done(23-01-25 19:29)

✘ Fix the last bullet ... it'd look better aligning with the first line instead of being between the two lines. @cancelled(23-01-25 19:33)
✔ 12. Consider sections with a different color background to create flow and distinction. Could even be just the whole Professional Experience section on a super light gray background with dark charcoal font. Optional. @done(23-01-25 23:01)
✔ 13. Prof Experience section on mobile looks pretty good, just same comment about switching to put the title first, company second, and omit location, but otherwise spacing and such feels ok (though could put more padding between each section) @done(23-01-25 19:36)
✔ 14. I like the WhyMe section on mobile better (the vertical layout) ... desktop feels a little busy with the text right up to the colored pillars, but I'm not sure you have space to put more padding there ... @done(23-01-25 19:36)
✔ On mobile, check the lazy loading ... I almost had to go past the WhyMe H1 for "self starter" to load @done(23-01-25 19:32)
✔ 15. On desktop - Let's connect loaded before "self starter" ... makes for an odd experience. @done(23-01-25 19:39)
✔ 16. Contact me - same comments as the one up top ... make it highlight the green color (and on mobile it stays highlighted with blue text) @done(23-01-25 19:39)
☐ 17. Just missing a portfolio, which I know is coming.
